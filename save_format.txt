There are 3 types of data representations for values in the save file:
    * A single decimal number written as a float, e.g. 47.000000
    * A string of concatenated flags, each followed by a + character, e.g. "1+2+21+"
    * A string mapping a set of keys to lists of values. Each value is followed by a & character. Each key's list is followed by a > character. e.g. "2=7&400&>0=121&"

For each field in the save file, the field name, data type (num, list or map) and meaning (if known) are noted below. gameName is the only field which is not one of these 3 types, since it is directly taken from user input.
